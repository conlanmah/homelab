After kinda a hassle I got NFS working via Nix. Clients like NFSv3, which I didn't realize and therefore required more firewall rules. Now I just need to get permissions correct. I feel like most security issues are avoided by the fact that the NFS shares are only accessible on the 192.168.150.0/24 VLAN, which is not routable... So the security of that is basically the security of the hosts of that VLAN, which is NixOS and Proxmox.
