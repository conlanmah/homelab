Finished diagrams for basic networking, and used those ip's to install proxmox.

Installed Proxmox on Catpuccin, Nord, and Gruvbox. Everforest is staying on NixOS for me to test ethernet cables. 

Initially gave Nord 192.168.100.2 instead of .3, so it's boot message references .2 incorrectly.

Installed everything as ZFS RAID0 for a single boot device using the SSD. I will have to manage the subscriptions on each node, not sure if thats something I should do before or after clustering.
