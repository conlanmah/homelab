- Yesterday, configured Everforest host, 3rd PVE node with external HDD storage
	- This will be used for a virtualized Proxmox Backup Server
- Issues with Immich
	- "System Integrity" core issue might be permissions, shares, or UID/GID shenanigans
	- Very manual fix of creating check files as required
	- Currently running fine, but I have no clue what caused the issue .
