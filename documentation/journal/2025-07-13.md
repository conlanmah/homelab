This was actually like 2 days ago, but when installing proxmox on the mini pc's I encountered an issue with grub. Installing using ext4 defaults to using GRUB, while using zfs defaults to systemd boot. For some reason GURB just doesn't detect the Proxmox OS, so when installing as ext4, I had to enter with Proxmos installer rescue mode and execute the following:

```bash
proxmox-boot-tool format /dev/sda2 # reformat boot partition
proxmox-boot-tool init /dev/sda2 # set up boot partition and detect entries to add. This uses systemd by default
proxmox-boot-tool refresh # not sure if this was required
```

I ended up reinstalling Proxmox using ZFS in RAID0 for the boot device.
