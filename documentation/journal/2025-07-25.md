Bullet points are good:
- Shucked the second drive, T330 is good to go
- Realized the ZFS won't work for shared storage, need to replan how the T330 is gonna work
- Trying to get wireguard working over WAN via port forwarding
- Realized the switch didn't have a default route configured
- Fixed the default route issue and got wireguard working over WAN!
