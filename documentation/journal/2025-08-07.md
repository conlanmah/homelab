- Create nfs share for immich
- Recreate immich container when moving mediaLocation
- More firewall and accessibility issues that I don't know if I fully solved
- Running into integrity issues with the `.immich` file being created and tested under `<mediaLocation>/encoded-video`
	- This causes the service to perpetually restart, and clients cannot access it.
	- Rebooting the container gets it to work.
- Considering how to provide secure and discretionary access to the internet. I'm thinking self host headscale in a VPS and then use Tail Scale
