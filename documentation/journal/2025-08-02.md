- Create Proxmox cluster with nord and catpuccin
	- Initial issue with nord having 192.168.100.2 configured in /etc/hosts instead of 192.168.100.3
	- Using 192.168.100.0/24 for the main cluster communication with 192.168.150.0/24 as a backup because apparently shared storage shouldn't be on the same NIC as cluster traffic which is time sensitive.
- Change nord and catpuccin repositories
	- Disable enterprise repositories
	- Enable free repositories
