Yesterday was mostly building a flake and figuring out the general work flow I want for all these vms.

Okay problems:
- Do I use another tool for managing configuration of multiple machines? Right now I am attempting to use raw flakes and then write my own wrapper. But Colmena or Deploy-rs are options.
- The Pi doesn't inherently trust the build produced by my laptop. This can be fixed with some imperative steps, but obviously I don't want to take those as that impacts easy reproducibility.

I think I finally got the remote build of the pi to work:
- command used: `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#rpi3-wireguard --target-host conlan@192.168.100.101 --use-remote-sudo`
- Fix, add `nix.settings.trusted-users = [ "root" "conlan" ];` to the initial iamge
- I did have to enter in the password like 3 times for some reason
- And whats awesome is that after the first build, consecutive builds were not super long!
