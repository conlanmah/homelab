Making the base container template for nixos, is this slightly frustrating due to the 'impure'-ness of my resulting configurations, and I understand why flakes lock and track inputs now. But, I think due to the nature of nixos it's not a super large issue if a container is created using one image or another... With terraform as well, I should be able to configure everything IaC.
