Examined UPS, determined what I need to buy for a replacement battery, will probably do that next year.

Restarting everything, I noticed that the wg-pi still lacked an ip address. I disabled network manager and upgraded to nixpkgs 25.11. Hard cutting power to the switch and pi to test if it comes back online correctly.
