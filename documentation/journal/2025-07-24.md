Few different things happened:
- Shucked the first harddrive
- 2nd harddrive passed the extended self test
- got the wireguard vpn working in a minimal form, missed a section about disabling rpfilter on the client
- realized that the rpi3B+ boots with an empty arp table and is inaccessible until it decides to ping something
-
