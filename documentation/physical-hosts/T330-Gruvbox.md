## ZFS configuration

This is imperative, because by nature it is done a single time and there is no good, non-destructive way to do so imperatively. Disko will destroy data.


ZFS Tuning from https://jrs-s.net/2018/08/17/zfs-tuning-cheat-sheet/:
- ashift=12
	- Critical, must match underlying physical sector size, 4KiB
- compression=lz4
	- Very fast, will not become a bottle neck and will save space
- atime=off
	- Usually not necessary to track 'accessed' on each file. Must be done very frequently so saves cpu.
- recordsize=128K
	- Stick with default as HDD's latency is mostly seek time so therefore this is not super important?
- SLOG=maybe?
	- Kinda like journalling, useful in event of a crash but requires reliable flash storage, which the SSD is not?..

Commands:
```bash
sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 tank mirror /dev/sda /dev/sdb
# -f needed to overwrite existing fs's
sudo zfs set compression=lz4 tank

sudo zfs set atime=off tank
# zfs commands applied to pool because its the 'root dataset' which is just at the top level of the pool

# Reservation to ensure pool performance
sudo zfs create -o refreservation=3T -o mountpoint=none tank/reserved
```

## Datasets


| Name   | Purpose               | NFS                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| vdisks | Proxmox Virtual Disks | 192.168.150.0/24(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) |
| isos   | Linux ISOs            | 192.168.150.0/24(ro,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) |

no_root_squash is slightly insecure, but not a super large issue as the NFS shares are fairly inaccessible.

Commands for `isos` because proxmox expects a file structure if it can't write.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /tank/isos/template/cache
sudo mkdir -p /tank/isos/template/iso
sudo chown -R root:root /tank/isos/template
sudo chmod -R 755 /tank/isos/template
```
